# Schedule Builder Export

# Description
This extension allows you to quickly and easily import Schedule Builder schedules into Google Calendar.
# Installation
Add to Chrome through the Web Store <a href=">here</a>. 

If you would like to contribute, you can clone this repository and upload it through <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> -> Load Unpacked Extension after enabling Developer Mode. You'll also need an API key and client-id. 

# Usage
<b>Important:</b> You must be signed into <em>Chrome</em> (not Google) using the account you wish to use.

First, finalize your schedule as normal in Schedule Builder. The extension will add an "Export!" button to the Schedule Builder UI.
When you are ready, click Export! and enter the number of weeks and start date of the quarter as prompted.
Click Go! and your Google Calendar will automatically be populated with your courses, including labs, discussions, etc.
After exporting, you can change the color, title, etc. as desired directly through Google Calendar (you will only need to edit the first event in the series).
